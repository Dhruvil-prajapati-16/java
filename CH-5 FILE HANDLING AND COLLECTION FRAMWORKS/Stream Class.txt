### Basics of Stream Classes in Java

Stream classes in Java provide a way to read from and write to data sources such as files, arrays, and sockets. They are part of the `java.io` package and are categorized into two main types: byte streams and character streams.

#### Byte Streams
Byte streams handle I/O of raw binary data and are suitable for reading and writing binary files, such as images, audio files, and other types of non-text data. They use the following two abstract classes:
- **`InputStream`**: This is the base class for all byte input streams. It provides methods to read bytes from a source.
    - **Common subclasses**: `FileInputStream`, `ByteArrayInputStream`, `BufferedInputStream`.
    - **Example**:
      ```java
      FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("input.dat");
      int data = fis.read();
      while (data != -1) {
          System.out.print((char) data);
          data = fis.read();
      }
      fis.close();
      ```
- **`OutputStream`**: This is the base class for all byte output streams. It provides methods to write bytes to a destination.
    - **Common subclasses**: `FileOutputStream`, `ByteArrayOutputStream`, `BufferedOutputStream`.
    - **Example**:
      ```java
      FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("output.dat");
      fos.write(65); // Writes byte representation of 'A'
      fos.close();
      ```

#### Character Streams
Character streams handle I/O of characters and are ideal for text data, such as reading and writing text files. They use the following two abstract classes:
- **`Reader`**: This is the base class for all character input streams. It provides methods to read characters, arrays, and lines.
    - **Common subclasses**: `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, `InputStreamReader`.
    - **Example**:
      ```java
      FileReader fr = new FileReader("input.txt");
      int data = fr.read();
      while (data != -1) {
          System.out.print((char) data);
          data = fr.read();
      }
      fr.close();
      ```
- **`Writer`**: This is the base class for all character output streams. It provides methods to write characters, arrays, and strings.
    - **Common subclasses**: `FileWriter`, `BufferedWriter`, `OutputStreamWriter`.
    - **Example**:
      ```java
      FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("output.txt");
      fw.write("Hello, World!");
      fw.close();
      ```

### Summary
- **Byte Streams**: Use `InputStream` and `OutputStream` classes for reading and writing raw binary data.
- **Character Streams**: Use `Reader` and `Writer` classes for reading and writing text data.
- **Common Use Cases**: 
  - Byte streams: Binary files (images, audio).
  - Character streams: Text files.

Stream classes provide a simple and efficient way to handle input and output operations in Java, making it easier to work with various data sources and destinations.
